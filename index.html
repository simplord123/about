            <h4>The end of (Edo Period 1868)</h4>

            <br>
                <p>
                    I have fallen <br>
                    more times than I can count. <br>
                    Each time, <br>
                    I shattered — <br>
                    not just bone or blade, <br>
                    but the man I thought I was. <br> 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From blood-stained soil <br>
                    I gathered the fragments <br>
                    of who I used to be, <br>
                    cutting my hands <br>
                    on memory, <br>
                    on failure, <br>
                    on the echo of a name once proud. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    They thought I was beaten. <br>
                    Even I believed it once. <br>
                    But fire does not only destroy — <br>
                    it forges. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From ash, I rise. <br>
                    Again. <br>
                    And again. <br>
                    And again. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Not for vengeance. <br>
                    Not for glory. <br>
                    But for the promise <br>
                    that the battle inside me <br>
                    can be won. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I faced the enemy <br>
                    with my own eyes. <br>
                    He wore my doubts. <br>
                    He spoke in my voice. <br>
                    He knew my every weakness. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But I stood. <br>
                    Not as the man I was — <br>
                    but as the warrior I became. <br>
                    Each scar, a lesson. <br>
                    Each fall, a trial. <br>
                    Each breath, defiance. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And in the silence after the final clash, <br>
                    when my blade no longer trembled, <br>
                    I found something greater than victory: <br>
                    peace. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Not handed to me — <br>
                    but earned. <br>
                    Carved from pain. <br> 
                    Tempered in flame. <br>
                    Paid for in full. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I walk now not to escape the past, <br>
                    but to honor it. <br>
                    To carry the weight, <br>
                    without letting it break me. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This is my path. <br>
                    Not of perfection — <br>
                    but of perseverance. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From ash, I rise. <br>
                    And from within, <br>
                    I am whole. <br>
                    ---

                "Eyes to the Sky"<br>
                Five were called to watch the skies,
                But one stayed home, with doubting eyes.
                One came, but left when hope grew thin,
                One slept, the stars too slow to win.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One blinked and missed the fire’s flight,
                But one stayed still through silent night—
                And saw a meteor blaze the air,
                A gift for those who choose to care.
